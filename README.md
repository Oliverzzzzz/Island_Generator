## Credit Attribution
This Project was completed within a team, with contributions from Hamzah Rawasia, Sarim Zia, and Fiza Sehar. 

Sarim Zia contributed to this project by he;ping introduce the initial lagoon and oceans, determining and assigning which tiles are beaches, 
introducing rivers and the humidity that they bring to surrounding lands, accumulating the discharge of rivers that merge, introducing randomly generated aquifers,
and assigning biomes to each tile.

Fiza Sehar contributed to this project by allowing the user to choose the shape of the island, introducing rivers to the island, as well as the
accumulation of discharge, providing the option of the absorption profile, the option to select a whittaker diagram, and providing a seed to control randomness.

Hamzah Rawasia contributed to this project by creating the initial circular island, providing the option to define altimetric profiles, generating and
visualizing lakes, allowing the user to choose the number of rivers, the option to choose the absorption profile, as well as all implemetations related
to graphs, graph algorithms, cities, roads, and shortest paths between cities.

## How to run the product
COMMANDS

NOTE: You may need to run generator first in order to produce an initial mesh, which is needed for the testing

Generator:
java -jar generator/generator.jar -k irregular -h 1080 -w 1920 -p 1000 -r 5 -o ireg.mesh -d

Island:
java -jar island/island.jar -i ireg.mesh -o ireg2.mesh -s square -lakes 6 -rivers 10 -altitude hills -soil wet -biome Arctic -seed 123 -cities 5


Visualizer:
java -jar visualizer/visualizer.jar -i ireg2.mesh -o ireg_dbg2.svg

## How to contribute to the project

When you develop features and enrich the product, remember that you have first to `package` (as in `mvn package`) it so that the `jar` file is re-generated by maven.

| Id | Feature title | Who? | Start | End | Status |
|:--:|---------------|------|-------|-----|--------|
|  F01  |  Create a circular island composed of land only, and visualize the mesh |  Hamzah    | 27th Feb  |  Mar 15th   |    D    |
|  F02  |  Introduce the inner circle, as well as oceans and lagoonsh |  sarim    | 27th Feb  | Mar 15th  |    D    |
|  F03  |  Mark land tiles which touch the water as beaches and visualize this change |  sarim    | 27th Feb  |   Mar 15th  |    D    |
|  F04  |  Allow a user to choose the shape of the island to be generated, and visualize these islands |  Fiza    |  Mar 15th  |   Mar 15th   |    D    |
|  F05  |  Provide the option to define altimetric profiles to visualize peaks, plateaus, fields, valleys, etc. |  Hamzah    | Mar 23th  |  Mar 26th   |    D    |
|  F06  |  Generate and visualize lakes in the island, which can cover one or more tilese |  Hamzah    | Mar 15th  |  Mar 22th   |    D    |
| ~~F07~~ | ~~Visualize the changes to vegetation as a result of the nearby lakes~~ | ~~hamzah~~ | ~~21th Feb~~ | ~~21th Feb~~ | ~~D~~ |
|  F08  |  Introduce rivers which can be visualized, and bring humidity to lands around them |  Fiza, sarim    | Mar 22th  |  March 29th   |    D    |
|  F09  |  Allow the user to choose how many rivers will be displayed in the island using a command line argument |  Hamzah    | March 23th |  March 23th   |    D    |
|  F10  | Accumulate the discharge of rivers that merge and display the rivers as one combined river that is thicker. Account for the moisture the river brings based on the thickness of the river |  sarim,fiza    | march 25th  |  march 29th   |    D    |
|  F11  |  Provide the option to randomly generate the amount of aquifer. Based on this generate the aquifers and generate the moisture to the surrounding tiles. |  sarim    | Mar 26th  |  Mar 26th  |    D    |
|  F12  |  Provide the option to choose the absorption profile. Based on that generate the ability for the soil to absorb humidity from lakes, rivers, and aquifers. |  Hamzah,Fiza,Sarim    | March 26th  |  April 1ST   |    D    |
|  F13 |  Assign biomes to each tile and represent it with different colours based on the level of humidity and temperature. |  sarim    | Mar 26th  |  Mar 26th   |    D    |
|  F14 |  Provide the option to select a Whitaker diagram, and then to generate the biome based on the Whitaker diagram. |  Fiza    | Mar 26th |  April 2nd   |    D    |
|  F15  |  Provide the option to provide the seed of the random generator that will control randomness so that all the decisions taken are the same when regenerating. |  Fiza    | April 2nd  |  April 2nd   |    D    |
